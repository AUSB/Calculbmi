# BMI Calculator App
This project is to build an Android app that computes the BMI (Body Mass Index) given the weight w and height b of a person. If w is measured in kilograms and b in meters, then the index can be commuted using the formula: BMI = w/b2.

Two methods that transfer the kilograms and meters to pounds and feet and inches individually.
